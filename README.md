## Project requirements succesfully fulfilled

   - Used correct GitHub flow.
   - Fixed linter errors for HTML, CSS and JS.
   - Use GitHub Pages to deploy web pages.
   - Use JavaScript to manipulate DOM elements.
   - Use objects to store and access data.
   - Built the website for both mobile (<768px) and desktop (>768px).
   - Links
     - The home page should have a link in the menu to the about page.
     - The logo in the header links to the home page.
   - Mobile menu 
     - When the user clicks (or taps) the hamburger button on the header, the mobile menu appears over the page.
     - The mobile menu should have a close (X) button that closes the menu.
   - Dynamic page
     - The section "Featured speakers" should be created dynamically in JavaScript.
     - You should use a JavaScript variable with the data about the speakers and use it when the page loads to create the HTML for this section dynamically.

## Features
  - Dynamically created content, easy to edit through object index.
  - Working mobile menu with animated icons.
